Web Portfolio for June 2019

This portfolio is from-scratch HTML and CSS with some Bootstrap stylings. I chose a single-page "scrollspy"-esque layout with with navar links to the section tags. Some experimentatin led to the night-sky style design choice. I'm particularly fond of the div I like to call "The Eye of Sauron".
